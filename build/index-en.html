            <h3>Science and Business </h3>
            <p>Now, Sber is more than just a bank; it is also a major hi-tech company with a strong R&D capabilities. Our research and development results are the base for our competitiveness. Whether we are improving the efficiency of our own business processes, launching new products for retail or corporate clients, or developing solutions to transform entire sectors of the economy, our every step builds on achievements made by thousands of engineers and scientists of our laboratories and research centres, as well as our partners at leading universities and research institutions. And I am sincerely grateful to all of them! </p>
            <p>In 2021, Global Finance named Sber the World’s Best Digital Retail Bank. Our clients do not (and should not) know the names of those whose work supports these digital services, the world’s best. However, we know them all, and are proud of every one. </p>
            <p>In 2021, Sber scientists and developers received more than 90 invention patents, published and submitted for publication 77 academic papers (in leading global journals and at international A/A* level conferences), and received various awards. At the end of the year, they also won an international competition held at NeurIPS, the world’s largest conference, by showing the best results in training neural networks to solve the most complicated real-world problems.</p>
            <p>I have no doubt that with such a team, and with the spirit of ongoing scientific research and creative freedom that reigns at Sberbank, we can meet any challenge. I believe that in 2022 we will witness new achievements by our scientists, as well as more pioneering publications and inventions, and breakthrough ideas introduced via Sber’s technologies and products.</p>

            <h3>Science at Sber</h3><img src="img/photo_evimov_group.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Альберт Ефимов">
            <p>Today, Sber is a leading hi-tech company. It has researchers and engineers on board, who provides our platforms, products, and services with a competitive advantage. The results of developments are well known, generating real value for clients and improving the performance of Sber and its subsidiaries. The results are patentprotected and have won both national and international awards. Our open-source products are more and more idely used by developer communities all over the world.</p>
            <div class="six-screen__more">
              <p>However, we can look beyond the horizon too! Our research allows us to better understand the challenges and opportunities our teams will face in the future.</p>
              <p>Research is being conducted and innovations are being introduced across the Sber group, and our R&D teams include the best of the best researchers. The practical results of their activity often feature a significant degree of genuine scientific novelty. Therefore, our colleagues’ articles are regularly published in leading international scientific journals. We are actively expanding one of the Sber’s most important assets: its intellectual property. By December 2021 our engineers had obtained 226 patents, and that number is constantly growing. Rospatent awarded five of our inventions as the best inventions of the year in Russia. In 2021, our researchers published (and submitted for publication) over 70 academic papers in leading peer-reviewed scientific journals in Russia and abroad.</p>
              <p>Our research and innovations are carried out both by our own teams and by joining forces with leading universities, research centres, and technology partners around the world. Research performed jointly by Sber and universities expands our ability to create technological competitive advantage: together we achieve better results more quickly. This year, we launched new joint research activities with the Russian Quantum Center, Skoltech, HSE, MIPT, MIEM, MSU, MISIS, RES, and the Russian Academy of Sciences Institutes of Oceanology, Geography, and Computational Mathematics.</p>
              <p>About a year ago, we started considering the next step in supporting the fundamental research which is painfully needed, in order to build a national competitive advantage. This effort resulted in the launch of the Sber Science Award. In March 2022 we will announce the winners of all Award’s three categories: Physical Sciences, the Digital Universe, and Life Sciences.</p>
              <p>When you are regularly in touch with leading scientists and practitioners, you understand that world of science and corporations are changing right before our eyes. The distance between fundamental scientific discoveries and practical results that enable new products and new competitiveness is shrinking. Today’s science becomes tomorrow’s technology; the day after tomorrow, this technology becomes a product.</p>
              <p>The world has become significantly more complex. Sber’s place in this world of ‘new complexity’ is determined by its 180-year history, inextricably associated with the development of the Russian economy, and the new challenges being faced by major technology companies. Corporate developments are the key to tomorrow’s competitiveness, and research drives our ability to survive. Sber researchers make a significant contribution to this work.</p>
              <p>In this digest we present fundamental information on papers published by Sber researchers, discuss the Science Award and the results of predictive research, and introduce our key scientific partners. </p>
              <p>We believe that the new Science at Sber 2021 collection will prove to be an interesting and useful read!</p>

The results of this work are used to refine the credit scoring model and to identify fraud. An anomaly prediction system for servers has been developed. In addition, we have created a model to predict server load in highintensity periods, in order to optimise the server capacity growth strategy. We carry out works aimed at predicting the degradation of machine learning models over time, based on historical validation data. In 2021, we launched a project to develop promising power elements; that is, batteries for micro-electronic devices. </p>

                <p>The survey study <b>Scientific and Technological Disruptions</b> was conducted to build up Sber’s long-term strategy and ecosystem shaping. In the future, a few tens of key technologies will create a very new technological paradigm, and enable changes in the majority of industries and lifestyle that we are used to. We discussed ‘cutting-edge’ research carried out within 7 basic spheres (energy, infrastructure, telecommunications, materials, computation, biotechnologies, and interfaces). How will the industrial ‘thermonuke’ change force distribution in the global economy? Will our offices and living rooms relinquish electric sockets? Will a super computer fit into a smartphone, and will the smartphone be able to connect directly to satellites? Can DNA molecules store data? What will an augmented human body look like, and will it need gadgets to enter virtual and augmented reality?</p>
                <p><b>In 2022, we will definitely continue our effort to integrate scientific and technological forecasting into a corporate context, and to expandrelated ‘visibile areas.’</b></p>

                  <p>Metaverse fits perfectly into the modern technological context. On the one hand, a transition to the super high-speed 5G/6G mobile communications raises a need for a killer application, which provides demand on network capacities run at speeds of terrabits per second, rather than megabits or gigabits. Metaverse is the ideal candidate for this role.</p>

                  <p>The comparison of solutions suggested by the competitors was made using a dataset of 1,600 hours of traffic on roads in Russia, Israel and the US, in fine weather, snow, and rain. Basing on this data, teams evaluated to what extent ML models are able to tackle unknow road situations. The competition participants trained their algorithms on the data provided, then checked their performance against new data. The work carried out by the team is important for the development of selfdriven motor vehicles, and the possibility of applying the developed algorithms is already being elaborated, together with SberAutoTech company. </p><a href="https://research.yandex.com/shifts/vehicle-motion-prediction" aria-label="Read more">Read more</a>

                  <p>The neural networks trained by the team showed the best performance for passing through NetHack. This is the world of Labyrinth, where the player fights against various beings, trades, develops, and tries to capture a magic talisman. The game is considered to be one of the most difficult ones for artificial intelligence, due to numerous event development options and the strategy not being known in advance. For example, a long time has passed since machine learning models mastered chess, Dota 2, and Starcraft. Progress in resolving such tasks will lead to new achievements in autonomous transport and robotised delivery spheres, as well is as in the field of user interface testing automation. </p><a href="https://ludios.org/ivank/photos/Miscellaneous/" aria-label="Read more">Read more</a>

It is hard to single out one article, but it should be noted that Sber researchers participate and publish in the collection of proceedings for the most highly quoted world conferences on artificial intelligence and robotics. Articles and reports by leading SberDevices scientists are dedicated to various computer linguistics problems, as well as the specificity of working with the Russian SuperGLUE 1.1 benchmark and ruGPT-3 XL language model, which gained popularity last year. A range of papers written jointly by SberDevices researchers and the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory describe our contribution to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, and the problems of AI application in other medical areas, including analysing the effectiveness of drugs and the results of various instrumental examinations. Publications on human-machine interfaces are intended to help people with limited physical abilities, and to contribute to emerging of future neural interfaces. Our work helps to create next generation devices, which will be distinguished by a higher reliability regarding the recognition of electrical signals emitted by the human brain. </p>
